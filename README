Here's a few scripts I wrote a while ago when I needed to estimate the
amount of code written in core Tor by different contributors.

Please understand how it works, so you can understand its limitations.

It works by running "git log" to find all the commits for Tor over a
given period.  For each commit, it asks "git log" two things:
whose name is on the commit, and how many lines did it change?

Finally it looks for paid versus volunteer contributors, since we
sometimes need to figure this out for accounting purposes.

LIMITATIONS:

So as you can see from the above: this tool only counts lines of code
changed -- not the difficulty or significance of those changes.  And it
can't tell you when the line was merged -- only when it was written.
Make sure you understand that, or you'll be pretty confused by the
results.

This tool also counts everybody as "paid" or "volunteer" -- it has no
concept of people being paid for part of the time but not the rest.

HOW TO USE IT:

1. Edit the vollines.py script to contain the right year.

2. Run vollines.py from inside the git repository you want to measure.
